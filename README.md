# Hospital Management App

## Description
This project is an Android app that is intended for hospital use for monitoring and managing patients. Initially created for patients with mental health conditions, this app helps staff keep track of patients, staff, medications and other hospitals utilising this app. 

## Development
This app is solely intended for Android use and utilises a local database solely due to time and expense restrictions. Originally, the problem was for Android devices but this was changed after the prototype was provided due to conveniency on the client's end. 

For the future, the next stages of development for the app is to:
1. Convert it to cross-platform. 
2. Incorporate a cloud-database provider (AWS, Firebase, etc.) 
3. Improve design by creating a crisper and colourful/professional look.

## How to run
1. Open the app with Android Studio. 
2. Start the Android Emulator and run the app. 
3. Use the below credentials for admin access into the app.
Username: jdavis
Password: testpassword1
4. From here, you will see the Home page for Admins where you can view patients, staff, medication and hospitals. In each page you can add, edit and delete entries.
